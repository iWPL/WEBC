    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      I am a person learning Fullstack Web Development. I have an idea I want to
      build myself even though there are other open source solutions that
      already
    </p>
    <p>
      I am an IT professional and subject matter expert with significant
      training and development experience. For the last 23 years I have worked
      at ExxonMobil, a large and complex global organisation. I have a strong
      customer service focus ensuring that the customer’s requirements are
      consistently met in a friendly and efficient manner. I provide customers
      Break/Fix support for their PCs, as well as productivity enhancements and
      training for both large groups and individuals. I am an excellent Team
      worker, always happy to share knowledge and encourage colleagues, stepping
      in, when appropriate, to help out. I can also work independently,
      innovating new solutions and ensuring deadlines are met. I am eager to
      learn new skills and applications, and further develop existing
      capabilities.
